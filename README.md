These files are used in my master thesis "Market reaction to European Central Bank (ECB) 's bank payout restrictions". In March 2020, the implementation of a moratorium on shareholder remuneration by the European Central Bank (ECB) and national central banks in the euro area, UK, Sweden, and Norway aimed to bolster banks' capital reserves and ensure liquidity amidst the pandemic-induced economic downturn. The remuneration is that the banks supervised by these authorities were prohibited from paying dividends and buying back shares for an unspecified period. However, this ad-hoc policy decision triggered an unexpectedly negative market response. Considering this, the analysis endeavors to scrutinize variations in stock price reactions among European banks following the introduction of payout restrictions on March 27, 2020. This study also aims to uncover the underlying reasons behind the varying impact on banks' valuation.
